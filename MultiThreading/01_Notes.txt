#Multithreading in java

-> what is multithreading 
> it is a technology that allows the concurrent execution of 2 more threads with a single program.
> Each thread runs independently but shares the same proccess memory enabling efficent resource usage.

-> what are threads?
> threads in java are often reffered to as "lightweight" processess because they execute independently but at the same time communication with each other.
> Key Concepts
a) Threading 
b) Multitasking
c) Thread States: New, Runnable, Waiting, TimedWating and Terminator
d) Memory Sharing
e) Concurrency ->    |  |  |  |  -> multiple Threading can run in parellel.

â€¢ When a java application uses multithreading, several threads execute code with the same address space.
> all threads in a process share code, data and resources.
> synchornization is achieved.
> Java provides mechanisms such as syncronzed, wait(), notify() to comtrol thread interval.

> threads can be created in jave using:
    a) Extenion of "thread" class.
    b) Runnable interface

> Thread lifeCycle:

-> New: Thread created
-> Runnable: Thread is read to run, but waiting cpu time.
-> Runnity: Thread is currently executing.
-> Waiting/Timed Waiting: thread is paused waiting for some the thread action.
-> Terminated: Thread has finished execution.
