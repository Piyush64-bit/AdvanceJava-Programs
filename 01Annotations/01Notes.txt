Java
(Advance)

1. annotations are meta Data (data about data) that provide information to the
compiler, tools or runtime environment about how to process elements in your code.

2. They don't change the logic
  They provide additional insiruchias.

3. These are used by :
    a) Spring, hibernate frameworks
    b) IDEs and Compilers

→ Syntax
  @AnnotationName
  public void myMethod() {
    }
    The @interface
    that has 0/1
    abstract method

→ Common: Built-in Annotations in Java
    a) Compile time → @Override → tells method
                                 overrides a superclass
                                 method

    @Deprecated → marks method / class
                  as obsolete (out of date)

    @SupressWarnings → supress specific compiler
                       warnings

    b) Runtime /class → @Documented → includes annotations in Java
                                      docs

    c) Source control → @FunctionalInterface → means an interface is
                                                functional

    d) @target → @Target @Retention
