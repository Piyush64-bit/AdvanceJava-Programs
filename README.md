# Pick any folder and run the Java files
cd Annotations
javac MyOverride.java
java MyOverride

# Or try the Enumeration examples
cd ../Enumeration
javac EnumOne.java
java EnumOne

# Or explore Collections Framework
cd ../JavaCollectionsFrameWorks
javac CollectionsDemo.java
java CollectionsDemo

# Try the LeaderBoard ranking system
javac LeaderBoardExample.java
java LeaderBoardExample

# Test the LRU Cache implementation
javac LRUCacheExample.java

# Watch the magic happen! ✨
```

<details>
<summary>💡 <strong>Pro Tips</strong></summary>

- Each folder contains theory notes (`01Notes.txt`) — **READ THEM FIRST!**
- Run programs in the order they appear (EnumOne → EnumTwo → EnumThree → EnumFour)
- Try modifying the code and see what breaks (learning through destruction! 💥)
- Check out the Calculator subfolder for real-world enum applications

**What You'll Learn:**
- 🏗️ HashSet operations and duplicate handling magic
- 🗺️ HashMap key-value pair mastery and efficient lookups  
- 🎯 PriorityQueue implementation and custom ordering
- 🏆 LeaderBoard ranking systems with real-world applications
